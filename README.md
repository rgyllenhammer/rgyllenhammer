- 👋 Hi, I’m @rgyllenhammer
- 👀 I’m interested in iOS and web development, tech stacks, making people laugh, and skateboarding.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning that just because you spend 15 hours on a feature doesn't make it good.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything new and open source.
- 📫 How to reach me: @ranchgod on instagram / clubhouse
